## Demo

To get started...

```{.python}
from ibis_birdbrain.bots.birdbrain import bot

bot("who're you and what can you do?")
```

```html
birdbrain:

Hello! I'm known as 'birdbrain', but my full name is 'Ibis Birdbrain'. I was
created by the Ibis developers to assist data practitioners with their projects.
I have a variety of tools at my disposal. Here are some of the things I can do:

1. Access a data platform via Ibis.
2. Run SQL queries.
3. Generate and execute Python code.
4. Search the internet and summarize information.
5. Read files and summarize them.

My purpose is to facilitate your data analysis process and provide assistance
with tools like Ibis, SQL, and Python. Please let me know how I can assist you
today!

For more detailed information, you can check my documentation and source code:

- Ibis Documentation: [Ibis Docs](https://www.ibis-project.org)
- Birdbrain Source Code: (https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis-birdbrain)

Note that I always rely on factual and queried data for the information I
provide, and I will always cite my sources.
```

```{.python}
bot("what's the meaning of life?")
```

```html
birdbrain:

The meaning of life, according to my current state, is 42! This might be a
reference to "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" by Douglas Adams, where the
"Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, The Universe, and Everything" is
humorously stated as 42. However, the true meaning of life might be different
for each individual and could be found in personal growth, relationships,
helping others, or in the pursuit of knowledge. Always a fascinating topic to
ponder upon!

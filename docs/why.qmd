> >
> > \- [The International Organization for Standardization (ISO)](https://www.iso.org/standards.html)
> 
> \- [The Composable Codex](https://voltrondata.com/codex/standards-over-silos)

## Composable data systems are MICE

[Composable data systems are MICE: modular, interoperable, customizable, and extensible](https://voltrondata.com/codex/standards-over-silos).

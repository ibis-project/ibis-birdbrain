# Penguins data analysis project

This project involves an exploration and analysis of the `penguins` dataset. The dataset, originally collected by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica, Long Term Ecological Research (LTER), provides detailed data on three species of penguins from three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.

## Dataset

The `penguins` dataset includes measurements such as bill length, bill depth, flipper length, body mass, and categorical data such as species, island, and sex. The data is stored in an Excel file named 'penguins.xlsx' and is loaded into the project using Python.

## Analysis

The project aims to use this data to derive meaningful insights about penguin species, their physical characteristics, and their distribution across the islands.
